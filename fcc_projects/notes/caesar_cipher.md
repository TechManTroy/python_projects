### üìù **Note: Variable Scope in Functions (Python)**

**Topic:** Why `print(encrypted_text)` didn't work outside my function

---

#### ‚úÖ Problem I Had:

I defined `encrypted_text` **inside** my function `caesar()`, but tried to use it **outside** the function. Python gave me this error:

```bash
NameError: name 'encrypted_text' is not defined
```

---

#### üéØ Why That Happened:

In Python, **variables created inside a function only exist inside that function**. This is called **local scope**.

So if I do this:

```python
def caesar():
    encrypted_text = 'something'
```

Then try to do:

```python
print(encrypted_text)  # ‚ùå This will cause an error
```

It won‚Äôt work because `encrypted_text` is not visible **outside** the `caesar()` function.

---

#### ‚úÖ How I Fixed It:

I moved the `print()` statements **inside the function** like this:

```python
def caesar():
    encrypted_text = 'something'
    print(encrypted_text)  # ‚úÖ This works

caesar()  # Call the function so it runs
```

---

#### üìå Future Tip:

If I ever want to use a variable **outside** the function, I‚Äôll eventually need to learn about `return`, like this:

```python
def caesar():
    return 'something'

result = caesar()
print(result)
```

(But I haven‚Äôt learned that in freeCodeCamp yet!) 07/21/2025

**Goal:** Encrypt a message using a Caesar cipher.

### üîê Key Things to Remember

1. **Define variables before using them**

   * Make sure `text` and `shift` are defined **before** the loop or function that uses them.

2. **Indentation matters!**

   * Python uses indentation to group code. Anything that belongs inside the function (or loop) must be indented properly.

3. **Use `.lower()` when matching characters**

   * This ensures your text matches the lowercase alphabet you're using for encryption.

4. **Make sure `print()` statements are inside the function (if you want them to run when the function is called)**

   * If you define `print()` outside the function, they won't have access to variables like `encrypted_text` that are created inside the function.

5. **Call the function!**

   * Just defining `def caesar():` doesn't run the code inside. You must call it later with `caesar()`.

### ‚ùå Common Mistake I Made

> I placed the `print()` statements **outside** of the function, so the program didn't know what `encrypted_text` was when trying to print it.

**Fix:** Move the `print()` lines **inside** the function block.

### ‚úÖ Correct Structure (No Extra Concepts):

```
text = 'Hello Zaira'
shift = 3

def caesar():
  alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
  encrypted_text = ''

  for char in text.lower():
    if char == ' ':
      encrypted_text += char
    else:
      index = alphabet.find(char)
      new_index = (index + shift) % len(alphabet)
      encrypted_text += alphabet[new_index]

  print('plain text:', text)
  print('encrypted text:', encrypted_text)

caesar()
```

### üß† Updating Variable Names & Testing Caesar with Arguments

Goal: Understand how to pass variables to functions using arguments, and avoid mistakes with variable assignments.
üîÅ Why This Is Important

As your code grows, you‚Äôll often want to:

    Rename variables for clarity (e.g., message instead of text)

    Reuse functions by passing in different values

    Avoid hardcoding values like shift = 3 directly inside the function

‚úÖ Lesson: Match Variable Names Inside and Outside the Function

If you update a variable name (like renaming text to message), you must:

    Update all references inside the function to match the new name

    Pass those updated variables correctly when calling the function

‚úÖ Example with Clean Variable Passing

# Step 1: Define your input
```
message = 'Hello Zaira'
offset = 3
```
# Step 2: Caesar cipher with parameterized input
```
def caesar(message, offset):
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    encrypted_text = ''

    for char in message.lower():
        if char == ' ':
            encrypted_text += char
        else:
            index = alphabet.find(char)
            new_index = (index + offset) % len(alphabet)
            encrypted_text += alphabet[new_index]

    print('plain text:', message)
    print('encrypted text:', encrypted_text)
```

# Step 3: Assign values to new variables (optional, but must match)
```
text = message
shift = offset
```
# Step 4: Call the function with variables or direct values
caesar(text, shift)     # ‚úÖ Works
caesar(text, 13)        # ‚úÖ Also works (ROT13 test)

‚ùå Common Mistake I Made
```
text = 'message'
shift = 'offset'
```
    #This is assigning literal strings "message" and "offset" instead of referencing the variables named message and offset.

    #Later when the Caesar function tries to use offset, it breaks because it‚Äôs a string, not a number.

‚úÖ Correct Way
```
text = message     # references the actual message content
shift = offset     # references the actual numeric shift
```
Now everything works because the data types are preserved.
üß™ Tip for Testing:

Calling caesar(text, 13) is a common test of a Caesar cipher using ROT13, where letters are rotated halfway through the alphabet (13 positions). It‚Äôs a fun and easy test because applying ROT13 twice gives you the original message back!
